Description: An R package that is useful when working with a fake alligator dataset and you want to manipulate the orginal data. This function will help to reclassify column data by spliting up categorical data into addional categories. This function creates a linear regression and an ANOVA between animal classifications and HL ratios, creates a box plot, performs spatial analysis using k-means clustering, and exports the altered dataset to a new .csv.
