## An R package for processing fake alligator data

An R package that is useful when working with a fake alligator data set and you want to manipulate the original data. This function will help to reclassify column data by spiting up categorical data into additional categories. This function creates a linear regression and an ANOVA between animal classifications and HL ratios, creates a box plot, performs spatial analysis using k-means clustering, and exports the altered data set to a new .csv. (adjust this:This R package is useful for data exploration of a fake alligator data set. In this package there are ways to create new columns in the original data for further analysis. Additionally, this function generates k means clusters to explore and compare spatial differences.)
