\title{This function will be used to calculate the length to leukocyte ratio.}
\usage{
calc_length_leukocyte_ratio(data, column_a, column_b)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{the data set being used, should be .csv}

\item{column_a}{is the numerator in the equation, this should be the column where your HL ratios are housed.}

\item{column_b}{is the denominator in the equation, this should be the column where your total lengths are housed.}
}
\value{
a mutated data set that adds an additional column titled L_L_Ratio, this is the HL ratio divided by the total length.
}
\description{
The ratio is calculated by dividing the HL ratio by total length.
The new data is housed in a column titled L_L_Ratio.
